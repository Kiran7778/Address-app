# Address-app


Users enter a new username and password.

After clicking "Register", the system checks if the username already exists in localStorage.

If the username exists, the user is alerted with "Username already exists!".

If the username doesn't exist, the new username and password are stored in localStorage, and the user is alerted with "Registration Successful!".
