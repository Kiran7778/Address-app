# Address-app


Users enter a new username and password.

After clicking "Register", the system checks if the username already exists in localStorage.

If the username exists, the user is alerted with "Username already exists!".

If the username doesn't exist, the new username and password are stored in localStorage, and the user is alerted with "Registration Successful!".

The user is directed to the Address Records page, where they can manage and view contact information.

The dashboard includes various sections with action buttons like:

Address Records: View, add, or edit addresses.

View Graphs: View statistics, which could be linked to your application.

Date & Time: Access or manage a calendar and related features.

Logout: Sign out and go back to the login screen.
